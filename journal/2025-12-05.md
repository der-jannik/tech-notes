## Notes on learning [[rust]] with the [Rust Programming Full Course by BekBrace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ_J9WH6CGk)


### Introduction

- Systems programming language like C and C++
- Compiled language
- Named after Rust fungus
- Sponsored by Mozilla
- First version 2014
- Most admired language in Stack Overflow Developer Survey in 7 consecutive years 2024
- Over 80% want to use it again next years
- Winning by big in comparison to other languages, even Python
- Used by many big companies
- Trying to find the balance between speed, safety, concurrency and portability
  - Speed like C and C++
  - Saftey in memory management 
  - Concurrency means multi threads can run in parallel
  - Can compile on many platforms (portability)
- High level languages like Python use garbage collection for memory management
- Low level programming languages like C and C++ provide functions for memory allocation
- Rust has neither
- Uses a concept called ownership and borrowing
- Uses Cargo as package manager

### Setup / Installation

**Website**

- [Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org)
- Provides infos about the different application domains Rust can and is be used in
- Provides the source code of Rust and an open source book about Rust
- Provides the docs and guide to standard library
- Provides a book about the rust compiler `rustc`
- Provides a book about Cargo

**Installation**

- Via `rustup`
- Copy the command line instruction provided on the website 
- Verify installation via `rustup --version`, `rustc --version` and `cargo --version`
- Development possible via Visual Studio Code

### Hello World Program

- New folder 
- File `hello.rs`
- Entry point is the _main_ function

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

- Compile with `rustc hello.rs`
- Creates binary in same folder
- Can be run, prints the hello world message

### Make a cargo project

- Use CLI tool to create new project: `cargo new helloProject`
- Defined by `cargo.toml` file
- Source in `src` folder
- [[Git]] Repo with `.gitignore` is automatically initialized
- Compile and run by executing `cargo run`

### Primitive data types

- Statically typed programming language
- So data types need to be declared
- Primitive data types are also called scalar data types
- Declared by `let <variable name>: <data type>;`
- Declared and initialized by: `let <variable name>: <data type> = value;`

**Integers**

- Whole numbers
- Signed and unsigned integers of different sizes (size in bit)
- `i8, i16, i32, i64, i128`: Signed int
- `u8, u16, u32, u64, u128`: Unsigned int

**Float**

- Fractions
- `f32, f64`

**Boolean**

- `bool`: Can be `true` or `false`

**Char**

- Single character
- `char`

### Printing strings and Variables

```rust
println!("Hello {}", x)
```

### Comments

- With `//`

### Compound data types

to be continued

### Random thoughts and questions

- Data Races?
- 

## General programming terms and concepts

### Types of programming languages

- System programming language
- Compiled programming language
- High-level programming language
- Machine code

### Data in programming languages

- Memory management 
  - Garbage collection
  - Memory allocation
- Type system
  - Statically typed 
  - Dynamically typed
- Data types 
  - Literals
  - Ranges
  - Primary data types / scalar data types
  - Signed and unsigned data types
